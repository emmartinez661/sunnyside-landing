### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap Grid
- SASS
- Font Awesome
- Scroll Reveal



### What I learned

This is the first time I use a CSS preprocessor, and although I don't use a mobile first mode or way of working that is normally used with variables, it helped me to adapt to working with SASS.

I used for the first time the scroll reveal library to add effects to the elements.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```bootstrap.scss

```script.js 
to hide and add some functions to elements that I couldn't use css alone.


```index.js to see scroll reveal functions

```
